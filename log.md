### Day 1: june 4 , 2020 (BEATKEYS)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to revise the javascript baiscs. made a small sample from js30 challenge

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. javascript is fun but I guess it will take time to really be expert at it.
